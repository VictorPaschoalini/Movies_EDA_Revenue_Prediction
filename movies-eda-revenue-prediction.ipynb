It allows stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, distribution plans, and other critical aspects. This project embarks on an in-depth analysis of various features that might impact a movie's revenue, with the ultimate goal of developing a robust predictive model. This model aims to estimate the revenue of movies based on features such as budget, genre, production companies, and countries, release dates, and runtime.\n\n## Business Context\n\n**Background:**\nThe global film industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry with substantial economic impact and influence. Understanding the potential revenue a movie can generate is crucial for production companies, investors, and other stakeholders involved in the movie-making process.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nBuilding an accurate and reliable model to predict a movie's revenue can significantly enhance decision-making, budget allocation, and risk assessment. This project aims to fill this gap by utilizing a diverse dataset encompassing various aspects of movies and employing advanced machine learning techniques.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe primary objective is to explore, analyze, and model the dataset to predict the revenue of movies. The model's performance is continuously assessed and refined to ensure its reliability and accuracy.\n\n## Data Overview\n\nThe dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of movie data (The Movies Dataset - available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv), including features like:\n\n- **Budget:** The amount of money allocated for the movie production.\n- **Genres:** The categories or genres associated with the movie.\n- **Original Language:** The original language in which the movie was filmed.\n- **Production Companies:** The companies responsible for producing the movie.\n- **Production Countries:** The countries where the movie was produced.\n- **Release Date:** The date when the movie was released.\n- **Runtime:** The duration of the movie.\n- **Revenue:** The total revenue generated by the movie (target variable).\n\n## Analytical Approach\n\nThe project involves multiple steps including:\n\n1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the dataset is clean, and formatted correctly for analysis and modeling.\n2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the data distribution, relationships, and patterns.\n3. **Baseline Model Building:** Employing machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.\n4. **Model Refinement:** Making necessary adjustments for improvement.\n\nBy systematically executing these steps, the project aspires to deliver a dependable model for predicting movie revenues, contributing to the efficient and effective decision-making process in the film industry.\n\n## Conclusion and Future Work\n\nThe project promises insightful observations and a reliable predictive model for movie revenues (MAE ~9 MM USD). Future work may involve integrating additional data, employing more advanced modeling techniques, and exploring further feature engineering opportunities to boost the model's performance.\n\n\nAnother project of mine using some of the same datasets is Movie Revenue Prediction & Success Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/code/victorpaschoalini/movie-revenue-prediction-success-classification/notebook","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.1 Importing all the modules used in the project","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport ast\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T14:11:55.072237Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T14:11:55.072579Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T14:11:56.594626Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T14:11:55.072551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T14:11:56.593521Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2.
